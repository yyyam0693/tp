### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that in the sequence diagram above, the interactions between the command object and the `Model` are simplified.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* Alias validation uses `CommandWords` as the canonical source of reserved command words and allowed alias targets. `TOP_LEVEL_COMMAND_WORDS` defines reserved command words, while allowed alias targets are derived from it by excluding disallowed meta-commands. When adding a new top-level command, update both `AddressBookParser` and `CommandWords` so parsing and alias behavior stay in sync.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

Continuing the example of the `delete` command, the `Model` component executes the `deletePerson` method with a `Person p` as its argument. The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Model` component.

![Interactions Inside the Model Component for the `deletePerson` API Call](images/DeleteModelSequenceDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects. `Person` objects in the user's current list of contacts are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object. `Person` objects corresponding to contacts that are deleted in the current session are stored in a separate `DeletedPersonList` object.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as a _sorted_ and unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. Sorting is driven by a comparator set on the `Model`, and defaults to insertion order when no comparator is set.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find command

The `find` command is implemented as a small "pipeline" that converts user input into a single `PersonPredicate` object, and then updates the model's filtered person list by applying that predicate. The command supports text-based keyword matching (via `m/` prefix) and volunteer availability filtering (via `va/` prefix), either independently or combined. The diagram below summarizes the key classes and their relationships.

![Find Command Class Diagram](images/FindCommandClassDiagram.png)

#### Parsing flow

The sequence diagram below shows how the `find` command arguments are transformed into a `FindCommand` with the appropriate predicate.

![Find Command Parsing Sequence Diagram](images/FindCommandParsingSequenceDiagram.png)

The parsing flow is as follows:
* `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which instantiates a `FindCommandParser` for the `find` command.
* `FindCommandParser#parseArgs(...)` processes the argument multimap:
  * If the user provides an `m/` prefix, `FindMatchType.fromToken()` determines the match type; otherwise the default keyword match type is assumed.
  * If the user provides a `va/` prefix, `VolunteerAvailability.fromString()` parses the availability time period.
  * Keywords are extracted from the trailing content after the last prefix, or from the preamble when no prefixes are used.
  * All parsed arguments are stored in a `ParsedFindArgs` object.
* `FindCommandParser#buildPredicate(...)` creates the appropriate predicate:
  * **Keywords only**: `PersonContainsFieldsPredicateFactory.createPredicate(...)` returns a text-matching predicate.
  * **Availability only**: a `PersonAvailableDuringPredicate` is created, which checks that a volunteer's availability fully covers the queried time period.
  * **Both keywords and availability**: a `CombinedAndPersonPredicate` is created, which ANDs the text predicate and availability predicate together.
* `FindCommandParser` constructs the `FindCommand` with the predicate and returns it to `AddressBookParser`, which returns it to `LogicManager`.

#### Predicate structure

All find predicates implement `PersonPredicate`, which is a `Predicate<Person>`. There are three families of predicates:

**Text-matching predicates** share an abstract base class (`PersonContainsFieldsPredicate`) that:

* iterates through each keyword
* returns `true` as soon as any keyword matches any supported field (i.e. `OR` semantics across keywords)
* checks the keyword against most `Person` fields (e.g. name, phone, email, address, role, notes, tags)
* delegates the actual field-matching logic to `matchesField(...)`
* concrete predicate classes implement the `matchesField(...)` method, keeping the overall matching logic consistent and easy to extend

**`PersonAvailableDuringPredicate`** checks whether any of a person's `VolunteerAvailability` entries fully cover the queried time period (same day, starts at or before query start, ends at or after query end).

**`CombinedAndPersonPredicate`** takes a list of `PersonPredicate` objects and requires all of them to match (AND logic). This is used when both keywords and availability are specified.

#### Extending find

To add a new text match type in the future:

* implement a new subclass of `PersonContainsFieldsPredicate`
* add a new enum value and token in `FindMatchType`
* update `PersonContainsFieldsPredicateFactory.createPredicate(...)` to return the new predicate for that match type
* update any docs that mention match types (the parser logic does not need to change if the match type continues to be provided via `m/`)

To add a new filter dimension (like availability):

* implement a new `PersonPredicate` subclass
* integrate it into `FindCommandParser#parseArgs(...)` and `buildPredicate(...)`
* `CombinedAndPersonPredicate` can compose any number of predicates together

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### CSV import/export commands

The `import` and `export` commands extend the application with CSV file support. Both commands follow a similar flow: user input is parsed into a command object, and CSV-specific processing is handled by dedicated classes.

![CSV Import Export Class Diagram](images/CsvImportExportCommandClassDiagram.png)

At a high level:

* `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` identifies the command word and passes control to either `ImportCommandParser` or `ExportCommandParser`.
* The respective parser validates the file path and creates an `ImportCommand` or `ExportCommand`.

For the `export` command:

* `ExportCommand` retrieves the active list of persons from `Model`.
* It then calls `CsvWriterUtil` to convert the data into CSV format and write it to the file.

For the `import` command:

* `ImportCommand` calls `CsvReaderUtil` to read and process the CSV file.
* `CsvReaderUtil` validates the file (e.g. header row), parses each non-blank row, and returns a `CsvImportFileResult` containing:
    * successfully parsed rows (`CsvImportRowSuccess`)
    * invalid rows (`CsvImportRowError`)
* `ImportCommand` retrieves valid and invalid rows from `CsvImportFileResult`.
* For each valid row, `ImportCommand`:
    * checks for duplicates using `Model#hasPerson(...)` and previously imported entries
    * skips duplicates and records them
    * adds non-duplicate persons to the model
* Finally, `ImportCommand` returns a summary showing the number of imported, duplicate, and invalid rows.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of the `import` command.

![Import Command Execution Sequence Diagram](images/ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The CSV-specific logic is contained in the `logic.csv` package:

* `CsvReaderUtil` reads the file, validates its structure, and converts rows into structured results.
* `CsvWriterUtil` converts `Person` objects into CSV format and writes them to a file.
* `CsvImportFileResult` and related classes store parsed data and row-level errors.

This design keeps command classes focused on coordinating the workflow, while CSV-related processing is handled by specialised classes.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Is a volunteer coordinator who oversees manpower requirements of recurring events
* Manages contacts of 20-500 volunteers
* Works alone instead of in a team
* Prefers desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* Values data privacy
* May perform duties in locations without an Internet connection
* Dislikes slow, repetitive tasks (e.g., editing tags of contacts one at a time)

**Value proposition**: RosterBolt is a single-user, offline, CLI-first contact management tool for volunteer coordinators to manage volunteers of recurring events (20-500 people). RosterBolt aims to reduce overhead of volunteer coordinators by streamlining repetitive admin work (e.g. deleting/modifying contacts in bulk) to enable them to efficiently and accurately manage volunteer manpower.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**

1. The system should be able to handle up to 500 contacts without noticeable sluggishness during typical usage.
2. Bulk operations involving up to 100 contacts should complete within 2 seconds.

**Usability**

3. The system should provide clear feedback messages after each command to confirm successful execution or explain errors.
4. The system should be usable by a new user after reading the user guide once, without requiring external training.
5. A user with above-average typing speed should be able to accomplish most tasks faster using commands than using a mouse-driven interface.

**Reliability**

6. The system should automatically persist data after each command to prevent data loss in the event of unexpected termination.
7. If the data file becomes corrupted or invalid, the system should gracefully recover by resetting the data file or loading a safe default, instead of crashing.

**Offline Operation**

8. The system should function fully offline, without requiring any network connection during normal operation.
9. All documentation required for operation (e.g., help guide) should be accessible locally without internet access.

**Data Storage**

10. Application data should be stored in a human-readable file format (e.g., JSON or similar) so that advanced users can inspect or modify it using external tools.
11. The system should store all data locally on the user’s machine and must not depend on external databases or servers.

**Portability**

12. The application should work on any mainstream OS as long as Java 17 or above is installed.
